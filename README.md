### Delivery-sales-Data
## Overview 
This dataset captures operational and delivery performance metrics for courier services. Each record contains the courier’s years of experience, delivery time (in hours/days), fuel consumed (litres), fuel cost per litre, whether a breakdown occurred, type of breakdown, vehicle’s total mileage (km), and total fuel cost. It can be used to analyze factors affecting delivery speed, assess the impact of courier experience on efficiency, evaluate fuel consumption patterns, study the relationship between vehicle mileage and breakdown frequency, and estimate operational costs.
## Objective 
To provide insights into delivery operations by examining how courier experience, fuel consumption, vehicle mileage, and maintenance issues affect delivery times and overall operational costs. The goal is to identify opportunities to improve delivery efficiency, reduce fuel expenses, and minimize vehicle breakdowns
## Features of the data

Delivery Time – Time taken to complete the delivery (hours/days).

Fuel Consumed (litres) – Quantity of fuel used during the delivery.

Fuel Cost per Litre – Price of fuel per litre at the time of delivery.

Breakdown Occurred – Indicates whether a vehicle breakdown happened (Yes/No).
